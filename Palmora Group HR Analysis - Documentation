# DSA Data Analysis Final Project Documentation
This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class with the Incubator Hub. As a result, I completed the final project using the Plamorial Group data set.

## Project topic: 
Palmora Group HR Analysis

### Project overview
The Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions which are (Abuja, Kaduna Lagos).  The task to identify 
key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately. 

For this analysis, a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was carried out using the Power Bi tools and techniques relevant to the context of this dataset was employed. THis included: 
- Ingestion: this is connecting analytics system with the storage system.
- Transformation: Cleaning the data to remove unwanted (null, error values, blanks etc) data from the dataset
- Modeling: Analyzing how two or more tables (or data set) are related. 
- Visualization: interpreting the data visuals e.g. graphs, chart, etc
- Analysis: performing calculations with the data
- Presentation: submitting the findings for decision making
